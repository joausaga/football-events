# Understanding the European Football

 This study analyzea football (soccer in the US) events through a dataset composed of 941009 events collected from 9,074 European games. Details of the events are represented through 22 features, including the type of event (11 varieties, including foul, corner, offside, and red card), the minute in which the event happens, the side of the team involved in the event (home or away), the location of the event in the pitch (e.g., defensive half, attacking half, penalty spot), the game situation in which the event happens (e.g., open play, corner, free kick). If the event is a shot, the dataset provides also information of the shot place (e.g., bottom left corner, top left corner, center of the goal), the shot outcome (e.g., on target, off target, blocked), the part of the body involved in the shot (i.e., left foot, right foot, head), the method used to assist the shooter (e.g., pass, cross, headed pass), and a boolean variable that indicates whether the shot ends up as a goal. There are supplementary data about the events such as the team that generates the event or the players involved.
